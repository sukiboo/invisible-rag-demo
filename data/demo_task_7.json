        "Review – Hotel Chocolat Easter Egg | HungryHinny\nhttps://hungryhinny.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/review-hotel-chocolat-easter-egg/\n\nWell done Hotel Chocolat for making it easy to share between two people – although the pony promptly gobbled his and is now begging me for some of mine every time I have some…\n\nThe shell of the egg certainly does look a lot thicker than a normal egg, but it’s a bit deceiving as the edges are a lot thicker than the rest of the shell. It’s still a lot better than most eggs you would get though, and a really nice quality milk chocolate.\n\nI actually preferred the treats that came inside the egg though if I’m honest – the crunchy praline and chocolate brownie smiley eggs in particular were delicious and I wish I had more!\n\nThe You Crack Me Up Extra Thick Egg retails for £26 – considerable more than I would normally pay for an Easter egg, but I think the size, quality, taste and packaging combined do make it worth it if you really want a treat.\n\nYou can buy this egg and lots of other easter goodies from www.hotelchocolat.co.uk – thanks very much for sending me one for free!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShare this:\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\n2 thoughts on “Review – Hotel Chocolat Easter Egg”\n\nThat’s pretty cool!",
