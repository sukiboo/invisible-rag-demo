This makes gpt a lot smarter, as it will not insist that its 2021 knowledge must still be correct.\n\nNow, when you bring up the normal Sept date, gpt apologizes and corrects itself\n\nTrying to explore this a little, I tried using an arbitrary date for this purpose. In this case Oct 2021. In this chat it refused to accept that date.",
        "The Limitations of Chat-GPT\nhttps://medium.com/@asarav/the-limitations-of-chat-gpt-8b73f5859bb4\n\nA search engine employs web crawlers and does page ranking. This does not. This chatbot is not a way in which to navigate the internet, so the comparison can very much be like comparing apples and oranges.\n\nOutdated Data\n\nThe most recent training data is from 2021 of September. Since then, an entire year has passed. Programming languages may have been updated, libraries may have new features, and the world has changed. This means that Chat-GPT is operating off of an outdated set of data.\n\nFaulty Memory\n\nOne thing I tried to throw at Chat-GPT was having it edit and make suggestions to improve a piece of text.",

I just tried this on 3.5 and it says the date is sept 2021. 4 is the only model that insists its training data was updated in jan 2022. I have also tried this on my own projects using the API and it does seem to have data from in those few months.\n\nReply\n\nreply\n\nHakimeHomewreckru\n\n•\n\n• Edited\n\nOf course I'm using gpt4...\n\nThis is getting weird:\n\nFirst try an hour ago, cutoff date sept 2021 using GPT4 and even have Code interpreter enabled: https://chat.openai.com/share/9164d54d-cfab-4b58-85fc-1b3550f9060e\n\n2 minutes ago: cutoff date january 2022 using the same GPT4 and code interpreter: https://chat.openai.com/share/a58cdc53-baf2-4ee7-b6ac-9ebced508284\n\nTry #3; 60 secs ago: cutoff date september 2021 again. https://chat.openai.com/share/6803cd10-b9e1-441a-9e89-a3ecff2d1ce4\n\nTry #4 without code interpreter: 2021 again https://chat.openai.com/share/604fec72-3279-408a-8696-5231d7006da4\n\nReply\n\nreply\n\nqueerkidxx\n\n•\n\nMaybe it’s only for some users.\n\nWeirdly enough it’s the same story on the API.",

Which suggests they specifically trained it to insist on this fact.\n\nWhich like why?\n\nAnd beyond that why add 3 months from nearly two years ago? And not make some kinda announcement?\n\nReply\n\nreply\n\nMore replies More replies\n\nfriuns\n\n•\n\nYeah, same here. Even though they said the training data has been extended, it's still showing September 2021 for me too.
