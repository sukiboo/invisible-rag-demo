Mainly by threatening them. Seriously.

    "answer_2": "Here is a list of well-rated books in the science fiction and fantasy genres, along with a brief summary of each:\n\n## Science Fiction\n1.  *Fractal Noise* by Christopher Paolini: In this science fiction novel, a anomaly is detected on the planet Talos VII—a perfectly designed circular pit, as if created by conscious design. \n2. *Assassin for Hire* by Rick Deckard: This science fiction classic explores the story of a hunter who tracks down androids that have fled servitude for a life of freedom on Earth. \n3. *A Wrinkle in Time* by Madeleine L’Engle: This 1962 novel is a mix of science fiction and fantasy that explores quantum mechanics, time travel, and dimension hopping. \n4. *The Blazing World* by Margaret Cavendish: Arguably the first science fiction book ever written (published in 1666), this book tells the story of a woman from Earth who travels to another world through a portal at the North Pole, where she becomes empress of a society made up of half-animal, half-human species. \n5. *Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin: Le Guin is known for her iconic and memorable science fiction books, and this 1969 novel is no exception. Although the exact nature of the planet Winter is never fully explained, the story delves into the politics of a society made up of different species and genders. \n\n## Fantasy \n1. *Sabriel* by Garth Nix: This standalone fantasy novel follows a female data thief on a last-ditch run after her nervous system is crippled by vengeful former employees. \n2. *The Valdemar Books* by Mercedes Lackey: This series is set in a soft, classic fantasy world and features one of the first non-heterosexual main characters ever written.\n3. *A Game of Thrones* by George R. R. Martin: The first book in the *Song of Ice and Fire* series, this novel is an immense work of epic fantasy following an enchanting and enthralling narrative. \n4. *Encyclopaedia of Faeries* by Heather Fawcett: This cozy fantasy novel is a bit different from the others on this list, featuring a curmudgeonly professor who journeys to the far north to study faerie folklore and becomes entwined in dark fae magic, friendship, and love. \n5. *The Broken Earth Trilogy* by N.K. Jemisin: Although this trilogy is not as well-known as some of the other fantasy series, it is definitely worth a read. The novels are set in a world where magic, or 'orogeny', is hated and feared, and follow the story of a woman who becomes empowered by her own magical abilities. \n",
