When reading a large file .read() may return null, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new 'readable' event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the 'end' event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.\n\nTherefore to read a file's whole contents from a readable, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple 'readable' events:\n\nconst chunks = []; readable.on('readable', () => { let chunk; while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) { chunks.push(chunk); } }); readable.on('end', () => { const content = chunks.join(''); }); copy\n\nA Readable stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to readable.read(size), regardless of the value of the size argument.\n\nIf the readable.read() method returns a chunk of data, a 'data' event will also be emitted.\n\nCalling stream.read([size]) after the 'end' event has been emitted will return null.",

Must be a valid Buffer encoding, such as 'utf8' or 'ascii'.\n\nPassing chunk as null signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as readable.push(null), after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.\n\nThe readable.unshift() method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer.",

    "answer_1": "In the realm of streams, a chunk denotes a segment or fragment of data treated as a cohesive entity. It represents either an individual data unit or a collection thereof.\n\nFor instance, within the previously shared code snippet, each segment of the chat stream response is aggregated into a chunk, enabling later utilization in forming the complete content string.\n\nIn the context of Node.js, chunks can encompass various JavaScript data types, including strings, Buffers, Uint8Arrays, or null, specifically for streams not functioning in object mode. Conversely, in object mode streams, chunks can encompass any JavaScript value except null.\n\nFurthermore, when engaging with streams in JavaScript, one may encounter events such as 'data' or 'end' signifying the transmission or completion of chunks.",
    "answer_2": "In broad terms, a chunk constitutes a fragment or segment of a stream. Specifically, it denotes a set of data retrieved from a call to readable.read(). The dimension or extent of a chunk is contingent upon the chunk size parameter specified in the read() function.\n\nFor streams functioning outside of object mode, a chunk necessitates being either a string, Buffer, Uint8Array, or null. In contrast, for object mode streams, a chunk can encompass any JavaScript value.",
