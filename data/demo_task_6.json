        "How to Put Together Outfits: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Put-Together-Outfits\n\nA good way to make putting your outfit together easier is to pick one item and craft the entire outfit around that item. Usually, the specific item is one of the statement pieces, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nExample: If you're looking to showcase a big gorgeous necklace, wear a plain, neutral t-shirt with a neck that's cut so that the necklace can be seen. Pair this with jeans and a pair of flats. This way the necklace acts as the most important part of the outfit with nothing to draw attention away from it.\n\nYou can also work an outfit around a specific color.[3]",

An odd number of details is more effective at capturing your gaze. Odd numbers force your eyes to move around the grouping…That forced movement is the heart of visual interest. It’s for that reason that a set of three is more appealing and memorable than something paired off in two’s”. - www.apartmenttherapy.com\n\nSo, using that as the guide, the simple formula for putting an outfit together is to build it from 3 pieces of clothing.

    "answer_1": "Let's start with a base piece from your wardrobe and build outwards from there. Since you specified that you couldn't wear both the black and white shirt, let's pick the white shirt and build an outfit around that. \n\nHere is a suggested outfit combination, using only one type of clothing once: \n\n3,5\n\nThis outfit combines red shoes with a white shirt and blue jeans. The jeans are a neutral colour which means that the red shoes will be the standout piece of the outfit. The white shirt will help to tone down the red shoes and make the outfit suitable for more occasions. \n\nThe suggested outfit is a very simple way of putting together your outfit which still has a unique element. Using odd numbers when combining clothes creates visual interest and forces the eyes to move around the grouping. Overall, you have a very balanced selection of items in your wardrobe and you are using the principles of balancing odd numbers to capture your gaze.",
