# Invisible RAG Pilot Demo App

A public demo version of the [üîí Invisible RAG Pilot app üîí](https://github.com/sukiboo/invisible-rag) developed by Anton Dereventsov, Christina Munford, Davide Marchi, Dora Franjkovic, and Julia Naris in February 2024 for the Invisible RAG Pilot project.
The demo app is deployed at Hugging Face Spaces at [https://huggingface.co/spaces/sukiboo/invisible-rag-demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sukiboo/invisible-rag-demo).

The goal of the app is to establish an appropriate interface for the operators to evaluate the provided RAG-Generated Answers with the intent of increasing the evaluation quality and bringing down the AHT.‚ö°

The main functionality includes:
- convenient interface for task comparison and evaluation
- support concurrent task access for collaborative work
- saving and loading of the operated tasks capability
- storing operator's justification for a given rating
- synchronizing ratings to the tracking spreadsheet
